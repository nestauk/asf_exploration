# ## Summary: to report to MCS

# %% [markdown]
# * About 11% of domestic installation records in the MCS dataset relate to new builds (13,420 records).
# 
# * The biggest installer of new build HPs is ... with ... installations. The second and third biggest installers of new build HPs are ... (... installations) and ... (... installations).
# 
# * The average reported cost of a new build installation is about £840 less than a retrofit (£11,760 compared to £12,600).
# 
# * About 83% of properties in the EPC dataset which are labelled as being new dwellings with a heat pump are not found in the MCS dataset (89,485 properties).
# 
# * Some "new dwellings with a heat pump" in the EPC dataset appear in the MCS dataset with a commissioning date that is more than 1 year after the EPC inspection date. These could be properties getting their original heat pump replaced or getting a second heat pump installed, but they could also indicate errors in the MCS dataset.
